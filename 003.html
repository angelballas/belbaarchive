<div class="block">
Two instrumental pieces constructed as a linked pair, marking the transition between two adjacent moments in time. Both compositions were built using the Roland SP-606, preserving the grain and character of the original sampled material.
<br><br>
BEFORE SUNSET retains a sense of presence and tonal density, while AFTER SUNSET moves toward reduction and suspension. Together, they form a continuous passage, defined by gradual change rather than contrast.
<br><br>
Produced in Athens, Greece.
